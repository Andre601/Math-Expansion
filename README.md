# Math-expansion
This expansion lets you calculate different values (including nummerical placeholders).

The syntax is `%math_<math expression>%`, where `<math expression>` can be any kind of math expression, supported by EvalEx.
Placeholders are also supported, but you have to use `{}` and not `%`

Supported math is addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (*) and dividing (/) to name a few.

## Credits
Math-expansion uses [EvalEx](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx) for evaluating the math-expressions.  
Check the repository for available math-expressions.
